# and I will seek the group's insight.

# Reflect!
# 
# This was very tough for me. I thought I had looping down, but I cannot figure out how to make a destructive method
# using .each. Perhaps there is a method that I am missing.
#
# Unfortunately, I didn't find out a solution to this, so I find it difficult to identify something that I learned. Also,
# my group did not have time to convene to combine all of our work together. At least, if we did, I didn't know!
#
# I am not entirely confident with this objective. It was tough for me, and unfortunately I did not give myself enough time to work
# through it. I hope that I can figure it out in the future and I will continue to work with it.
